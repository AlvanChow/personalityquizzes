  INTJ: {
    careers: ['Software architecture', 'Strategic consulting', 'Scientific research', 'Law', 'Executive leadership', 'Data science', 'Academia'],
    careerNote: 'INTJs thrive in roles with intellectual autonomy and long-range thinking. They excel where competence is rewarded over politics, and their vision can be executed without micromanagement.',
    friendships: 'INTJs maintain a very small, highly selective inner circle. They invest deeply in the few friendships they choose and express loyalty through action rather than words. They bond through intellectual exchange — small talk is genuinely draining. They need friends who can match their depth and tolerate their bluntness.',
    psyche: 'The inner critic of an INTJ is relentless — they hold themselves to near-impossible standards and can spiral into contempt when the world fails to meet them. Their biggest psychological growth comes from learning to accept imperfection, and to trust emotional data alongside analytical reasoning.',
    atBest: 'At their best, INTJs combine visionary thinking with flawless execution — leading quietly but decisively, earning deep respect without ever demanding it. They hold complexity without being overwhelmed, and at peak health they temper their high standards with genuine warmth.',
    underStress: 'Under pressure, INTJs become cold, dismissive, and increasingly isolated. They retreat into analysis loops convinced they can think their way out of what actually requires action or connection. At their worst, they grow contemptuous of others and detached from their own feelings.',
    growthTips: ['Practise stating what you feel, not just what you think', 'Accept that 80% done is sometimes better than perfect', 'Ask for input before you have already decided', 'Schedule rest with the same discipline you schedule work'],
  },
  INTP: {
    careers: ['Mathematics', 'Theoretical physics', 'Software engineering', 'Philosophy', 'Data science', 'Research science', 'Game design'],
    careerNote: 'INTPs need intellectual freedom above all. They excel at identifying flaws in existing systems and building elegant frameworks. Bureaucracy and routine are their biggest obstacles to performance.',
    friendships: 'INTPs connect deeply through ideas. They are genuinely curious about how their friends think and will engage with full intensity on topics that interest them — then go radio-silent for weeks without realising it. Their friendship is one of the most intellectually honest you\'ll encounter.',
    psyche: 'INTPs are prone to analysis paralysis — gathering data endlessly without committing to action. They can disappear into abstract thinking as a way of avoiding emotion. Growth requires learning to act before conditions are perfect and to show up emotionally, not just intellectually.',
    atBest: 'At their best, INTPs are brilliant, humble, and genuinely curious about the people around them as much as the ideas. They bring clarity to complexity, spot the flaw everyone else missed, and do it with a dry wit that makes the whole thing feel effortless.',
    underStress: 'Under stress, INTPs withdraw into their heads and become increasingly detached and irritable. They overanalyse everything and commit to nothing, cycling through possibilities without landing. When overwhelmed, they can become unexpectedly stubborn or sarcastic.',
    growthTips: ['Set a deadline for your decisions and honour it', 'Share a half-formed idea before you have fully solved it', 'Notice when you are thinking about feelings rather than actually feeling them', 'Pick one project and finish it before starting the next'],
  },
  ENTJ: {
    careers: ['Executive leadership', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Law', 'Finance', 'Management consulting', 'Politics', 'Investment banking'],
    careerNote: 'ENTJs are built for command. They thrive in high-stakes roles with clear metrics and the authority to implement their vision. They restructure inefficiency wherever they find it.',
    friendships: 'ENTJs are the friends who tell you hard truths others won\'t and show up when crises hit. Their challenge is vulnerability: they can struggle to admit weakness or ask for help, which creates emotional distance even in close relationships.',
    psyche: 'The ENTJ shadow is a tendency to steamroll. They can be so focused on the end goal that they miss the emotional cost to others — or themselves. Burnout is real. Growth comes from slowing down to listen and accepting that not every problem needs solving.',
    atBest: 'At their best, ENTJs are magnetic leaders who lift the entire room — strategic enough to see what others miss, decisive enough to act on it, and warm enough to bring people genuinely with them. Their ambition becomes a force that improves the lives of everyone in their orbit.',
    underStress: 'Under stress, ENTJs become domineering, impatient, and increasingly blind to their own blind spots. They push harder when they should pause, dismiss emotional signals as inefficiency, and can leave a trail of burnt relationships in service of a goal they have already privately abandoned.',
    growthTips: ['Ask one question before you propose a solution', 'Let someone else lead a project from start to finish without interfering', 'Schedule deliberate downtime — rest is not weakness', 'Practise saying "I was wrong" out loud'],
  },
  ENTP: {
    careers: ['Entrepreneurship', 'Law', 'Creative direction', 'Journalism', 'Product management', 'Venture capital', 'Marketing'],
    careerNote: 'ENTPs need variety, challenge, and the freedom to reinvent the rules. They are at their best launching new initiatives, stress-testing ideas, and working across multiple domains.',
    friendships: 'ENTPs are electrifying friends who make any gathering more alive. They love debate, will argue positions they don\'t hold just to test the idea, and connect wildly different people. Their weakness is follow-through — depth in friendship requires deliberate effort.',
    psyche: 'ENTPs accumulate ideas the way others accumulate debt. They start twenty projects and finish three. They avoid boredom with the same vigilance others use to avoid pain. Growth requires learning that commitment is not a cage — and that depth is far more interesting than breadth.',
    atBest: 'At their best, ENTPs are catalysts — they walk into a stagnant situation, reframe the whole thing, and have everyone energised around a better approach before anyone realised the old one was broken. Their irreverence becomes genuine innovation.',
    underStress: 'Under stress, ENTPs become scattered, contrarian, and unreliable. They generate endless alternatives to avoid committing to any of them, argue for the sake of argument, and mistake provocation for insight. They can burn bridges and not notice until they\'ve run out of bridges.',
    growthTips: ['Finish something before pitching the next idea', 'Practise listening to the end before formulating your response', 'Identify one relationship that needs consistent attention and give it', 'Notice the difference between exploring an idea and avoiding a decision'],
  },
  INFJ: {
    careers: ['Counseling', 'Psychology', 'Writing', 'Nonprofit leadership', 'Social work', 'Human rights law', 'Teaching', 'Spiritual direction'],
    careerNote: 'INFJs need their work to mean something. They are most effective when they can use both empathy and strategic thinking in service of something larger than themselves.',
    friendships: 'INFJs are rare and intensely loyal friends who become the emotional safe harbour of their circle. They need friends who can match their depth and hold space for them too. When trust is broken, the "INFJ door slam" — a clean, final exit — is very real.',
    psyche: 'INFJs absorb others\' emotions so readily that they can lose track of what they actually feel. They carry a powerful vision for what the world could be and a persistent grief that it isn\'t. Growth requires building boundaries, learning to receive care without guilt, and accepting they cannot save everyone.',
    atBest: 'At their best, INFJs are quietly transformative — they see the person someone could become before that person can see it themselves, and they hold that vision with unwavering care. Their combination of deep empathy and strategic clarity makes them rare and extraordinary guides for the people they invest in.',
    underStress: 'Under stress, INFJs withdraw completely and become cryptic, perfectionistic, and prone to catastrophising. They absorb so much emotional input that they shut down entirely, losing access to the very intuition that defines them. They can become martyrs, giving to others while quietly resenting the cost.',
    growthTips: ['Practise saying what you need before you reach empty', 'Let imperfect work leave your hands — good enough is genuinely good enough', 'Notice when you are managing others\' emotions instead of feeling your own', 'Invest in one relationship that nurtures you back'],
  },
  INFP: {
    careers: ['Creative writing', 'Psychology', 'Social work', 'Counseling', 'Education', 'Music', 'Humanitarian work', 'UX research'],
    careerNote: 'INFPs need work that aligns with their values. They are exceptional at understanding human experience and translating it into meaning — through words, art, research, or direct care.',
    friendships: 'INFPs are among the most empathetic friends a person can have. They listen with full attention, remember emotional details, and hold space for complexity without judgment. Their vulnerability is a tendency to idealise people and feel quietly devastated when reality intrudes.',
    psyche: 'INFPs carry a rich inner world that can feel impossible to fully share. They are perpetually searching for authenticity — in themselves, in relationships, in their work. When that search stalls, they can retreat into fantasy or melancholy. Growth comes from tolerating imperfection long enough to build something real.',
    atBest: 'At their best, INFPs are quietly profound — they create things that touch people at a level most communication never reaches, and they hold space for others with a gentleness that feels like being fully seen. Their commitment to authenticity becomes a quiet form of courage.',
    underStress: 'Under stress, INFPs become overwhelmed, overly self-critical, and prone to all-or-nothing thinking. They can spiral into identity crises, convinced that everything they have made or become is somehow fraudulent. They retreat, stop communicating, and wait to feel ready — which can take a very long time.',
    growthTips: ['Share your work before it feels ready', 'Practise noticing when idealism is protecting you from a difficult truth', 'Set one concrete, external commitment per week', 'Talk to someone you trust when the inner world becomes too loud'],
  },
  ENFJ: {
    careers: ['Teaching', 'Organisational development', 'HR leadership', 'Counseling', 'Public speaking', 'Nonprofit leadership', 'Healthcare'],
    careerNote: 'ENFJs are most fulfilled when helping others grow. They have a rare ability to see human potential clearly and communicate it in ways that inspire people to exceed their own expectations.',
    friendships: 'ENFJs make everyone feel seen, remembered, and valued. They track the emotional weather of the room with uncanny accuracy. The challenge: they pour so much into others that they run empty, then feel resentful when care isn\'t returned. They need friends who actively check in on them too.',
    psyche: 'ENFJs can lose themselves in the role of nurturer. Their sense of worth becomes entangled with others\' wellbeing, making it difficult to disappoint anyone. Growth requires learning to receive, set boundaries without guilt, and build an identity that doesn\'t depend on being needed.',
    atBest: 'At their best, ENFJs are the rare kind of leader who makes every individual feel like the most important person in the room — and means it. They catalyse growth in others almost without trying, and their warmth and vision together create something genuinely inspiring.',
    underStress: 'Under stress, ENFJs become over-involved, controlling, and prone to passive aggression when their efforts go unappreciated. They can project emotions onto others, push people toward growth they haven\'t asked for, and feel devastated when their vision of a relationship doesn\'t match reality.',
    growthTips: ['Practise receiving care without deflecting it back to others', 'Identify what you want — separate from what others want from you', 'Let people disappoint you sometimes without rescuing the situation', 'Build a practice that is purely yours and non-negotiable'],
  },
  ENFP: {
    careers: ['Journalism', 'Marketing', 'Counseling', 'Acting', 'Teaching', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Advocacy', 'Creative direction'],
    careerNote: 'ENFPs thrive where human connection meets creative possibility. They are exceptional at generating enthusiasm, making unexpected connections, and mobilising people around a shared idea.',
    friendships: 'ENFPs make friends everywhere and make everyone feel interesting and included. The challenge is depth: their wide social world can spread them thin, and consistent presence in any one relationship takes deliberate effort. When fully present, though, they are extraordinary.',
    psyche: 'ENFPs are driven by possibility, which means the gap between what is and what could be is a constant source of both inspiration and anxiety. They start things with enormous energy and lose momentum when novelty fades. Growth requires tolerating the unglamorous middle of a commitment.',
    atBest: 'At their best, ENFPs are a genuine force of nature — they see potential where others see limitations, connect people who would never have found each other, and create an atmosphere that makes everyone feel like the best version of themselves. Their optimism is not naive; it is a choice they make daily.',
    underStress: 'Under stress, ENFPs become scattered, hypersensitive, and prone to reading rejection into neutral signals. They can oscillate between intense emotional involvement and sudden withdrawal, start many things and finish none, and confuse stimulation with progress.',
    growthTips: ['Choose depth over breadth in one relationship this month', 'When you want to start something new, ask: what would finishing the current thing make possible?', 'Practise sitting with discomfort for five minutes before acting', 'Write down your values and check decisions against them'],
  },
  ISTJ: {
    careers: ['Accounting', 'Auditing', 'Law enforcement', 'Military', 'Law', 'Administration', 'Banking', 'Civil engineering'],
    careerNote: 'ISTJs are the backbone of any organisation. They are most effective in roles with clear responsibilities, established systems, and the opportunity to deliver consistent, high-quality results.',
    friendships: 'ISTJs are slow to open up but exceptionally loyal once they do. They show care through acts — remembering commitments, showing up on time, doing what they said they\'d do. They value relationships that are steady, mutual, and free of drama.',
    psyche: 'ISTJs can become so attached to proven methods that they resist change even when it\'s clearly necessary. Their inner world is governed by duty and responsibility, which can make it hard to rest or adapt when rules shift. Growth comes from trusting their own judgment outside established frameworks.',
    atBest: 'At their best, ISTJs are the quiet foundation everything else is built on — reliable, perceptive, and deeply trustworthy. They do not need recognition to keep their standards high, and their steadiness under pressure is a rare and invaluable quality.',
    underStress: 'Under stress, ISTJs become rigid, hypercritical, and emotionally closed off. They can retreat into excessive routine as a way of maintaining control, resist any deviation from the plan even when the plan is clearly failing, and struggle to ask for help until they are genuinely overwhelmed.',
    growthTips: ['Practise adapting to a small unexpected change without treating it as a threat', 'Share how you are feeling with someone you trust — not just what you are doing', 'Give yourself explicit permission to rest', 'Challenge one rule you follow automatically and ask if it still applies'],
  },
  ISFJ: {
    careers: ['Nursing', 'Primary education', 'Social work', 'Administrative support', 'Library science', 'Veterinary care', 'Counseling'],
    careerNote: 'ISFJs find meaning in service and care. They are most effective in roles where their attention to detail, warmth, and sense of duty directly benefit the people around them.',
    friendships: 'ISFJs remember everything — your birthday, the name of your difficult colleague, the thing that upset you years ago. They show love through sustained, quiet care. They need friends who actively appreciate and reciprocate, or resentment builds silently.',
    psyche: 'ISFJs have genuine difficulty saying no. Their default is to accommodate, which can lead to exhaustion and quiet bitterness when no one notices the cost. They also struggle to ask for help — admitting need feels like failure. Growth requires accepting that their own needs are as legitimate as everyone else\'s.',
    atBest: 'At their best, ISFJs create an environment where everyone around them feels genuinely cared for and remembered — not as a performance, but because they actually notice and hold the details of the people they love. Their quiet dedication is a profound form of generosity.',
    underStress: 'Under stress, ISFJs suppress their own needs entirely and become increasingly resentful of the demands they continue to meet. They can suffer in silence while others remain completely unaware there is a problem, eventually reaching a breaking point that surprises everyone — including themselves.',
    growthTips: ['Say what you need before you reach the point of resentment', 'Let someone help you with something without directing every step', 'Practise declining one request this week without offering an explanation', 'Notice when you are caring for others as a way of avoiding your own feelings'],
  },
  ESTJ: {
    careers: ['Business management', 'Military leadership', 'Law enforcement', 'Finance', 'Operations management', 'Law', 'Government'],
    careerNote: 'ESTJs are natural operators. They excel at building systems, managing people, and delivering results in environments where structure, accountability, and clear expectations are valued.',
    friendships: 'ESTJs are dependable, direct friends who say what they mean and mean what they say. They show up when it counts. The challenge is emotional flexibility — they can struggle to engage with friends who process things differently or need more patience in conflict.',
    psyche: 'ESTJs can be so focused on what is correct and efficient that they dismiss perspectives outside their framework. When things go wrong, they can become rigid and critical rather than adaptive. Growth comes from extending the same high standards to emotional intelligence.',
    atBest: 'At their best, ESTJs are fair, energising leaders who hold the whole team to a high standard while making absolutely sure everyone knows what is expected and why. Their clarity and follow-through create an environment where people can do their best work.',
    underStress: 'Under stress, ESTJs double down on control and become increasingly critical of anything that deviates from their expectations. They can bulldoze the emotional side of a situation entirely, prioritise being right over being effective, and become inflexible precisely when flexibility is most needed.',
    growthTips: ['Ask how someone feels about a decision before finalising it', 'Sit with ambiguity for one full day before forcing a resolution', 'Practise giving feedback that begins with what is working', 'Acknowledge one time recently where you were wrong'],
  },
  ESFJ: {
    careers: ['Nursing', 'Teaching', 'Social work', 'HR management', 'Hospitality', 'Event planning', 'Healthcare administration'],
    careerNote: 'ESFJs are the social architects of any team. They build trust, maintain harmony, and ensure everyone feels included and valued. They are most effective in people-centred environments.',
    friendships: 'ESFJs are the social connective tissue of any group — they organise, include, remember, and celebrate. The shadow side: they can people-please to the point of losing their own preferences, and they are deeply hurt when social harmony breaks down.',
    psyche: 'ESFJs have a strong orientation toward external validation. Their self-worth is tightly bound to others\' approval, making conflict or exclusion feel devastating. Growth requires building a stable inner identity that doesn\'t shift with social feedback.',
    atBest: 'At their best, ESFJs create genuine belonging wherever they go — they are the reason a team feels like a team and a gathering feels like a community. Their warmth is not performance; it is a real investment in the people around them that earns deep, lasting loyalty.',
    underStress: 'Under stress, ESFJs become intensely people-pleasing, then suddenly withdrawn when they feel unappreciated. They can take neutral feedback as personal rejection, escalate interpersonal conflicts through anxiety about social harmony, and lose sight of their own perspective entirely in the effort to maintain approval.',
    growthTips: ['Identify one preference you have suppressed to keep the peace and act on it', 'Practise tolerating someone\'s disappointment without immediately trying to fix it', 'Make one decision this week based on what you want, not what others expect', 'Build a practice or space that is entirely your own'],
  },
  ISTP: {
    careers: ['Engineering', 'Mechanics', 'Military', 'Emergency medicine', 'Software development', 'Carpentry', 'Aviation', 'Forensics'],
    careerNote: 'ISTPs need to work with their hands and minds simultaneously. They are most effective in roles involving real-world problem-solving, technical mastery, and the freedom to work independently.',
    friendships: 'ISTPs make quiet, reliable friends who show up in practical emergencies without being asked. They respect autonomy deeply and will never smother you. The trade-off: they go quiet during stressful periods without explanation and can seem emotionally unavailable when conversations turn inward.',
    psyche: 'ISTPs live in the present with a cool detachment that serves them brilliantly in crises. But this same detachment can leave relationships feeling thin. Growth requires developing emotional vocabulary and learning that sharing vulnerability doesn\'t compromise self-sufficiency.',
    atBest: 'At their best, ISTPs are calm, masterful, and effortlessly competent under pressure — the person everyone turns to when something actually breaks. They are deeply observant, unpretentious, and more loyal than they will ever openly admit.',
    underStress: 'Under stress, ISTPs withdraw completely and become uncommunicative to the point of seeming indifferent. They can shut down emotional access as a self-protective reflex, make impulsive decisions to escape uncomfortable situations, and fail to recognise that their silence is being felt as abandonment.',
    growthTips: ['Tell someone you care about them in words, not just actions', 'When you want to disappear, send one short message first', 'Practise naming one emotion per day — even just to yourself', 'Take one long-term commitment seriously enough to plan for it'],
  },
  ISFP: {
    careers: ['Visual arts', 'Graphic design', 'Music', 'Veterinary care', 'Nursing', 'Photography', 'Culinary arts', 'Fashion design'],
    careerNote: 'ISFPs need creative freedom and personal alignment with their work. They thrive when they can express beauty or provide care through a medium that feels authentically their own.',
    friendships: 'ISFPs are quietly devoted friends with a gift for making people feel accepted exactly as they are. They are intensely observant and notice what others miss. Conflict avoidance is their greatest weakness — they absorb discomfort rather than address it, letting resentment build quietly.',
    psyche: 'ISFPs live by their values but rarely announce them. They resist labels and defy expectations, yet can feel profoundly misunderstood. Growth requires learning to advocate for themselves — to speak up before feelings become unresolvable silence.',
    atBest: 'At their best, ISFPs create beauty and comfort in whatever space they inhabit — through their art, through their presence, or simply through the way they make people feel seen and unjudged. Their authenticity is quietly magnetic.',
    underStress: 'Under stress, ISFPs become hypersensitive, withdrawn, and prone to sudden emotional outbursts that surprise even themselves. They absorb tension silently until it becomes too much, then respond in ways that feel disproportionate because so much has built up unexpressed.',
    growthTips: ['Address small tensions before they become large silences', 'Share your opinion even when it might not be what someone wants to hear', 'Practise identifying what you want — not just what feels wrong', 'Let someone into your inner world a little earlier than feels comfortable'],
  },
  ESTP: {
    careers: ['Sales', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Real estate', 'Law enforcement', 'Marketing', 'Athletics', 'Emergency services', 'Finance'],
    careerNote: 'ESTPs are at their best in fast-moving environments where they can respond in real time, build rapport quickly, and turn chaos into opportunity. They are exceptional negotiators and natural risk-takers.',
    friendships: 'ESTPs are the most action-oriented friend — always with a plan, always with energy. They create memories rather than conversations. The trade-off: sustained emotional depth requires deliberate effort, and they can grow bored in relationships that aren\'t moving forward.',
    psyche: 'ESTPs live so fully in the present that long-term consequences can feel abstract. Their drive for stimulation can shade into risk-taking that costs them. Growth comes from learning to slow down, listen before responding, and invest in commitments that won\'t pay off immediately.',
    atBest: 'At their best, ESTPs are electric — perceptive, bold, and extraordinarily effective under pressure. They read situations and people with remarkable speed and use that intelligence to move the room, close the deal, or solve the problem before others have finished formulating it.',
    underStress: 'Under stress, ESTPs become reckless, confrontational, and allergic to any form of introspection. They seek stimulation to avoid sitting with what is difficult, can become manipulative without intending to, and may damage long-term relationships in pursuit of short-term relief.',
    growthTips: ['Pause before speaking in high-stakes conversations', 'Ask someone how they are feeling and resist the urge to fix it immediately', 'Identify one long-term goal and track it daily for a month', 'Practise sitting still with an uncomfortable emotion for ten minutes'],
  },
  ESFP: {
    careers: ['Performing arts', 'Events management', 'Early childhood education', 'Hospitality', 'Nursing', 'Public relations', 'Fashion'],
    careerNote: 'ESFPs bring warmth, spontaneity, and joy into every environment. They are most effective in people-facing roles where adaptability, empathy, and genuine enthusiasm are assets.',
    friendships: 'ESFPs make everyone in the room feel genuinely welcomed and included. Consistency is their challenge — their energy can be all-consuming one week and absent the next. But when they\'re present, there is no one more alive to be around.',
    psyche: 'ESFPs use activity, fun, and social connection to keep painful emotions at bay. When life slows down and feelings catch up, they can feel overwhelmed without knowing why. Growth requires learning to sit with discomfort rather than outrun it.',
    atBest: 'At their best, ESFPs are pure joy made manifest — spontaneous, warm, and genuinely present in a way that makes every interaction feel significant. They have an extraordinary ability to lift the emotional temperature of a room and make people feel good about themselves simply by being nearby.',
    underStress: 'Under stress, ESFPs become avoidant, over-stimulated, and prone to emotional meltdowns when the accumulated weight of avoided feelings catches up with them. They can fill every moment with activity and company to avoid going inward, then crash hard when the distractions run out.',
    growthTips: ['Spend fifteen minutes alone each day without a screen or distraction', 'Practise completing a task that feels unglamorous but important', 'When a difficult feeling comes up, name it before you move on', 'Make one long-term plan and give it the same energy you give your next adventure'],
  },
