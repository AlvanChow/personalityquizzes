  INTJ: {
    careers: ['Software architecture', 'Strategic consulting', 'Scientific research', 'Law', 'Executive leadership', 'Data science', 'Academia'],
    careerNote: 'INTJs thrive in roles with intellectual autonomy and long-range thinking. They excel where competence is rewarded over politics, and their vision can be executed without micromanagement.',
    friendships: 'INTJs maintain a very small, highly selective inner circle. They invest deeply in the few friendships they choose and express loyalty through action rather than words. They bond through intellectual exchange — small talk is genuinely draining. They need friends who can match their depth and tolerate their bluntness.',
    psyche: 'The inner critic of an INTJ is relentless — they hold themselves to near-impossible standards and can spiral into contempt when the world fails to meet them. Their biggest psychological growth comes from learning to accept imperfection, and to trust emotional data alongside analytical reasoning.',
  },
  INTP: {
    careers: ['Mathematics', 'Theoretical physics', 'Software engineering', 'Philosophy', 'Data science', 'Research science', 'Game design'],
    careerNote: 'INTPs need intellectual freedom above all. They excel at identifying flaws in existing systems and building elegant frameworks. Bureaucracy and routine are their biggest obstacles to performance.',
    friendships: 'INTPs connect deeply through ideas. They are genuinely curious about how their friends think and will engage with full intensity on topics that interest them — then go radio-silent for weeks without realising it. Their friendship is one of the most intellectually honest you\'ll encounter.',
    psyche: 'INTPs are prone to analysis paralysis — gathering data endlessly without committing to action. They can disappear into abstract thinking as a way of avoiding emotion. Growth requires learning to act before conditions are perfect and to show up emotionally, not just intellectually.',
  },
  ENTJ: {
    careers: ['Executive leadership', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Law', 'Finance', 'Management consulting', 'Politics', 'Investment banking'],
    careerNote: 'ENTJs are built for command. They thrive in high-stakes roles with clear metrics and the authority to implement their vision. They restructure inefficiency wherever they find it.',
    friendships: 'ENTJs are the friends who tell you hard truths others won\'t and show up when crises hit. Their challenge is vulnerability: they can struggle to admit weakness or ask for help, which creates emotional distance even in close relationships.',
    psyche: 'The ENTJ shadow is a tendency to steamroll. They can be so focused on the end goal that they miss the emotional cost to others — or themselves. Burnout is real. Growth comes from slowing down to listen and accepting that not every problem needs solving.',
  },
  ENTP: {
    careers: ['Entrepreneurship', 'Law', 'Creative direction', 'Journalism', 'Product management', 'Venture capital', 'Marketing'],
    careerNote: 'ENTPs need variety, challenge, and the freedom to reinvent the rules. They are at their best launching new initiatives, stress-testing ideas, and working across multiple domains.',
    friendships: 'ENTPs are electrifying friends who make any gathering more alive. They love debate, will argue positions they don\'t hold just to test the idea, and connect wildly different people. Their weakness is follow-through — depth in friendship requires deliberate effort.',
    psyche: 'ENTPs accumulate ideas the way others accumulate debt. They start twenty projects and finish three. They avoid boredom with the same vigilance others use to avoid pain. Growth requires learning that commitment is not a cage — and that depth is far more interesting than breadth.',
  },
  INFJ: {
    careers: ['Counseling', 'Psychology', 'Writing', 'Nonprofit leadership', 'Social work', 'Human rights law', 'Teaching', 'Spiritual direction'],
    careerNote: 'INFJs need their work to mean something. They are most effective when they can use both empathy and strategic thinking in service of something larger than themselves.',
    friendships: 'INFJs are rare and intensely loyal friends who become the emotional safe harbour of their circle. They need friends who can match their depth and hold space for them too. When trust is broken, the "INFJ door slam" — a clean, final exit — is very real.',
    psyche: 'INFJs absorb others\' emotions so readily that they can lose track of what they actually feel. They carry a powerful vision for what the world could be and a persistent grief that it isn\'t. Growth requires building boundaries, learning to receive care without guilt, and accepting they cannot save everyone.',
  },
  INFP: {
    careers: ['Creative writing', 'Psychology', 'Social work', 'Counseling', 'Education', 'Music', 'Humanitarian work', 'UX research'],
    careerNote: 'INFPs need work that aligns with their values. They are exceptional at understanding human experience and translating it into meaning — through words, art, research, or direct care.',
    friendships: 'INFPs are among the most empathetic friends a person can have. They listen with full attention, remember emotional details, and hold space for complexity without judgment. Their vulnerability is a tendency to idealise people and feel quietly devastated when reality intrudes.',
    psyche: 'INFPs carry a rich inner world that can feel impossible to fully share. They are perpetually searching for authenticity — in themselves, in relationships, in their work. When that search stalls, they can retreat into fantasy or melancholy. Growth comes from tolerating imperfection long enough to build something real.',
  },
  ENFJ: {
    careers: ['Teaching', 'Organisational development', 'HR leadership', 'Counseling', 'Public speaking', 'Nonprofit leadership', 'Healthcare'],
    careerNote: 'ENFJs are most fulfilled when helping others grow. They have a rare ability to see human potential clearly and communicate it in ways that inspire people to exceed their own expectations.',
    friendships: 'ENFJs make everyone feel seen, remembered, and valued. They track the emotional weather of the room with uncanny accuracy. The challenge: they pour so much into others that they run empty, then feel resentful when care isn\'t returned. They need friends who actively check in on them too.',
    psyche: 'ENFJs can lose themselves in the role of nurturer. Their sense of worth becomes entangled with others\' wellbeing, making it difficult to disappoint anyone. Growth requires learning to receive, set boundaries without guilt, and build an identity that doesn\'t depend on being needed.',
  },
  ENFP: {
    careers: ['Journalism', 'Marketing', 'Counseling', 'Acting', 'Teaching', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Advocacy', 'Creative direction'],
    careerNote: 'ENFPs thrive where human connection meets creative possibility. They are exceptional at generating enthusiasm, making unexpected connections, and mobilising people around a shared idea.',
    friendships: 'ENFPs make friends everywhere and make everyone feel interesting and included. The challenge is depth: their wide social world can spread them thin, and consistent presence in any one relationship takes deliberate effort. When fully present, though, they are extraordinary.',
    psyche: 'ENFPs are driven by possibility, which means the gap between what is and what could be is a constant source of both inspiration and anxiety. They start things with enormous energy and lose momentum when novelty fades. Growth requires tolerating the unglamorous middle of a commitment.',
  },
  ISTJ: {
    careers: ['Accounting', 'Auditing', 'Law enforcement', 'Military', 'Law', 'Administration', 'Banking', 'Civil engineering'],
    careerNote: 'ISTJs are the backbone of any organisation. They are most effective in roles with clear responsibilities, established systems, and the opportunity to deliver consistent, high-quality results.',
    friendships: 'ISTJs are slow to open up but exceptionally loyal once they do. They show care through acts — remembering commitments, showing up on time, doing what they said they\'d do. They value relationships that are steady, mutual, and free of drama.',
    psyche: 'ISTJs can become so attached to proven methods that they resist change even when it\'s clearly necessary. Their inner world is governed by duty and responsibility, which can make it hard to rest or adapt when rules shift. Growth comes from trusting their own judgment outside established frameworks.',
  },
  ISFJ: {
    careers: ['Nursing', 'Primary education', 'Social work', 'Administrative support', 'Library science', 'Veterinary care', 'Counseling'],
    careerNote: 'ISFJs find meaning in service and care. They are most effective in roles where their attention to detail, warmth, and sense of duty directly benefit the people around them.',
    friendships: 'ISFJs remember everything — your birthday, the name of your difficult colleague, the thing that upset you years ago. They show love through sustained, quiet care. They need friends who actively appreciate and reciprocate, or resentment builds silently.',
    psyche: 'ISFJs have genuine difficulty saying no. Their default is to accommodate, which can lead to exhaustion and quiet bitterness when no one notices the cost. They also struggle to ask for help — admitting need feels like failure. Growth requires accepting that their own needs are as legitimate as everyone else\'s.',
  },
  ESTJ: {
    careers: ['Business management', 'Military leadership', 'Law enforcement', 'Finance', 'Operations management', 'Law', 'Government'],
    careerNote: 'ESTJs are natural operators. They excel at building systems, managing people, and delivering results in environments where structure, accountability, and clear expectations are valued.',
    friendships: 'ESTJs are dependable, direct friends who say what they mean and mean what they say. They show up when it counts. The challenge is emotional flexibility — they can struggle to engage with friends who process things differently or need more patience in conflict.',
    psyche: 'ESTJs can be so focused on what is correct and efficient that they dismiss perspectives outside their framework. When things go wrong, they can become rigid and critical rather than adaptive. Growth comes from extending the same high standards to emotional intelligence.',
  },
  ESFJ: {
    careers: ['Nursing', 'Teaching', 'Social work', 'HR management', 'Hospitality', 'Event planning', 'Healthcare administration'],
    careerNote: 'ESFJs are the social architects of any team. They build trust, maintain harmony, and ensure everyone feels included and valued. They are most effective in people-centred environments.',
    friendships: 'ESFJs are the social connective tissue of any group — they organise, include, remember, and celebrate. The shadow side: they can people-please to the point of losing their own preferences, and they are deeply hurt when social harmony breaks down.',
    psyche: 'ESFJs have a strong orientation toward external validation. Their self-worth is tightly bound to others\' approval, making conflict or exclusion feel devastating. Growth requires building a stable inner identity that doesn\'t shift with social feedback.',
  },
  ISTP: {
    careers: ['Engineering', 'Mechanics', 'Military', 'Emergency medicine', 'Software development', 'Carpentry', 'Aviation', 'Forensics'],
    careerNote: 'ISTPs need to work with their hands and minds simultaneously. They are most effective in roles involving real-world problem-solving, technical mastery, and the freedom to work independently.',
    friendships: 'ISTPs make quiet, reliable friends who show up in practical emergencies without being asked. They respect autonomy deeply and will never smother you. The trade-off: they go quiet during stressful periods without explanation and can seem emotionally unavailable when conversations turn inward.',
    psyche: 'ISTPs live in the present with a cool detachment that serves them brilliantly in crises. But this same detachment can leave relationships feeling thin. Growth requires developing emotional vocabulary and learning that sharing vulnerability doesn\'t compromise self-sufficiency.',
  },
  ISFP: {
    careers: ['Visual arts', 'Graphic design', 'Music', 'Veterinary care', 'Nursing', 'Photography', 'Culinary arts', 'Fashion design'],
    careerNote: 'ISFPs need creative freedom and personal alignment with their work. They thrive when they can express beauty or provide care through a medium that feels authentically their own.',
    friendships: 'ISFPs are quietly devoted friends with a gift for making people feel accepted exactly as they are. They are intensely observant and notice what others miss. Conflict avoidance is their greatest weakness — they absorb discomfort rather than address it, letting resentment build quietly.',
    psyche: 'ISFPs live by their values but rarely announce them. They resist labels and defy expectations, yet can feel profoundly misunderstood. Growth requires learning to advocate for themselves — to speak up before feelings become unresolvable silence.',
  },
  ESTP: {
    careers: ['Sales', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Real estate', 'Law enforcement', 'Marketing', 'Athletics', 'Emergency services', 'Finance'],
    careerNote: 'ESTPs are at their best in fast-moving environments where they can respond in real time, build rapport quickly, and turn chaos into opportunity. They are exceptional negotiators and natural risk-takers.',
    friendships: 'ESTPs are the most action-oriented friend — always with a plan, always with energy. They create memories rather than conversations. The trade-off: sustained emotional depth requires deliberate effort, and they can grow bored in relationships that aren\'t moving forward.',
    psyche: 'ESTPs live so fully in the present that long-term consequences can feel abstract. Their drive for stimulation can shade into risk-taking that costs them. Growth comes from learning to slow down, listen before responding, and invest in commitments that won\'t pay off immediately.',
  },
  ESFP: {
    careers: ['Performing arts', 'Events management', 'Early childhood education', 'Hospitality', 'Nursing', 'Public relations', 'Fashion'],
    careerNote: 'ESFPs bring warmth, spontaneity, and joy into every environment. They are most effective in people-facing roles where adaptability, empathy, and genuine enthusiasm are assets.',
    friendships: 'ESFPs make everyone in the room feel genuinely welcomed and included. Consistency is their challenge — their energy can be all-consuming one week and absent the next. But when they\'re present, there is no one more alive to be around.',
    psyche: 'ESFPs use activity, fun, and social connection to keep painful emotions at bay. When life slows down and feelings catch up, they can feel overwhelmed without knowing why. Growth requires learning to sit with discomfort rather than outrun it.',
  },
