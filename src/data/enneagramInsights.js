  '1': {
    careers: ['Law', 'Medicine', 'Academia', 'Quality management', 'Social justice advocacy', 'Accounting', 'Engineering', 'Editing'],
    careerNote: 'Ones thrive in roles where precision, integrity, and improving standards matter. They are most satisfied when their work directly reduces error or injustice in the world.',
    friendships: 'Type 1s are reliable, principled friends who will always tell you the truth — sometimes more directly than you asked for. They hold themselves and others to high standards. Growth: learning to relax expectations and enjoy people as they are, not as they could be.',
    psyche: 'The core wound of Type 1 is the belief that they are fundamentally flawed and must be good enough to deserve love. The inner critic is relentless. Growth direction is Type 7 — learning spontaneity, joy, and the ability to accept that "good enough" can be genuinely good.',
  },
  '2': {
    careers: ['Nursing', 'Social work', 'Teaching', 'Counseling', 'HR', 'Hospitality', 'Community organising', 'Coaching'],
    careerNote: 'Twos are most fulfilled in roles where they can directly support, nurture, and uplift others. They need to feel their work is personally meaningful to the people they serve.',
    friendships: 'Type 2s are the most caring friends imaginable — they anticipate your needs, show up in crises, and make you feel deeply seen. The shadow: they can give in order to be needed, and struggle when care isn\'t reciprocated. Growth: learning to receive as naturally as they give.',
    psyche: 'The core wound of Type 2 is the belief that they must earn love by being indispensable. Beneath the warmth is a deep fear of being unwanted. Growth direction is Type 4 — learning to honour their own feelings and needs as valid in themselves.',
  },
  '3': {
    careers: ['Business', 'Marketing', 'Sales', 'Entertainment', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Politics', 'Public relations', 'Finance'],
    careerNote: 'Threes excel in competitive, visible environments where achievement is measurable and success is publicly recognised. They are natural motivators and adaptors.',
    friendships: 'Type 3s are motivating and energising friends who often push those around them to aim higher. They can be difficult to access emotionally — the mask of success rarely comes off. Growth: allowing friendships to be spaces of vulnerability, not performance.',
    psyche: 'The core wound of Type 3 is believing that they are only as valuable as their achievements. The self becomes the role. Growth direction is Type 6 — learning that real worth comes from loyalty, connection, and being present even when unimpressive.',
  },
  '4': {
    careers: ['Creative arts', 'Writing', 'Therapy', 'Design', 'Acting', 'Music', 'Fashion', 'Film', 'Psychology'],
    careerNote: 'Fours are most alive in work that allows self-expression and deals in emotional or aesthetic depth. They contribute a rare authenticity and creative vision that no one else can replicate.',
    friendships: 'Type 4s are the most emotionally present friends you can have. They embrace complexity, welcome depth, and never make you feel embarrassed for what you feel. The challenge: they can idealise people and then feel let down when reality arrives. Growth: staying with the ordinary.',
    psyche: 'The core wound of Type 4 is a sense of being fundamentally different — of having something essential that is missing. They long for what is absent. Growth direction is Type 1 — learning that disciplined, principled action (not feeling alone) is what creates meaning.',
  },
  '5': {
    careers: ['Research science', 'IT', 'Engineering', 'Academia', 'Data analytics', 'Philosophy', 'Writing', 'Programming'],
    careerNote: 'Fives are happiest in roles that reward deep expertise, independent thought, and the time to genuinely understand something. They need intellectual space and freedom from excessive social demands.',
    friendships: 'Type 5s are rare and precious friends — their loyalty is quiet but solid, their advice is carefully considered, and their observations are incisive. They need time to warm up and will disappear when overstimulated. Growth: learning to let people in before they\'ve fully figured them out.',
    psyche: 'The core wound of Type 5 is a deep fear of being depleted — of not having enough resources (time, energy, knowledge) to cope with the world. They hoard. Growth direction is Type 8 — learning to act decisively in the world rather than observing it from a safe distance.',
  },
  '6': {
    careers: ['Administration', 'Law enforcement', 'Military', 'HR', 'Healthcare', 'Teaching', 'Community building', 'Project management'],
    careerNote: 'Sixes excel in roles that involve building reliable systems, protecting others, and maintaining trust. They are most effective in environments with clear values and genuine community.',
    friendships: 'Type 6s are among the most loyal friends it\'s possible to have. Once trust is established, they show up consistently and without condition. They test loyalty carefully before opening fully. Growth: learning to trust their own judgment rather than constantly scanning for threat.',
    psyche: 'The core wound of Type 6 is a deep fear of being without support or guidance. They look outward for certainty the world cannot provide. Growth direction is Type 9 — learning to find a stable, calm centre within themselves that doesn\'t depend on external reassurance.',
  },
  '7': {
    careers: ['Entrepreneurship', 'Journalism', 'Travel', 'Event planning', 'Marketing', 'Entertainment', 'Consulting', 'Creative direction'],
    careerNote: 'Sevens are most energised in fast-moving, idea-rich roles with variety and freedom. They bring infectious optimism and a gift for reframing challenges as opportunities.',
    friendships: 'Type 7s are the most fun friends to be around — endlessly stimulating, spontaneous, and genuinely warm. Their limitation: they struggle with sustained emotional depth and can flee when things get heavy. Growth: learning that true intimacy requires staying when it gets uncomfortable.',
    psyche: 'The core wound of Type 7 is the avoidance of pain through constant stimulation and future-orientation. Joy is used as armour. Growth direction is Type 5 — learning to go deep, sit still, and find that what lies beneath the restlessness is not as terrifying as feared.',
  },
  '8': {
    careers: ['Entrepreneurship', 'Law', 'Military', 'Politics', 'Executive leadership', 'Crisis management', 'Real estate', 'Finance'],
    careerNote: 'Eights thrive in high-stakes, high-autonomy environments where they can lead, protect, and drive change. They need to feel in control of their own destiny.',
    friendships: 'Type 8s are fiercely loyal, protective friends who will go to war for the people they love. Vulnerability is rare — they see it as a risk. When they do open up, the trust is profound. Growth: allowing themselves to be protected occasionally, not just to protect.',
    psyche: 'The core wound of Type 8 is a terror of being controlled or betrayed. They armour up early. Intensity is the default. Growth direction is Type 2 — learning that genuine strength includes the courage to be warm, vulnerable, and openly caring.',
  },
  '9': {
    careers: ['Mediation', 'Counseling', 'Diplomacy', 'HR', 'Social work', 'Education', 'Environmental work', 'Religious ministry'],
    careerNote: 'Nines are exceptional in roles that require bringing people together, facilitating understanding, and creating spaces where everyone feels heard. They are the natural peacekeepers of any system.',
    friendships: 'Type 9s are the most accepting, non-judgmental friends possible. They hold space effortlessly and make everyone feel genuinely welcome. The cost: they can disappear into others\' preferences, losing their own voice. Growth: actively sharing their real opinions and desires.',
    psyche: 'The core wound of Type 9 is a fear that their presence and desires don\'t really matter — so they efface themselves to maintain peace. Growth direction is Type 3 — learning to pursue their own goals with energy and intention, and to believe that their agenda matters.',
  },
